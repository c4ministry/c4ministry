# Uploading a Sermon

## Record Sermon
After the reading of God's word will come the Prayer of Illumination. During that prayer, begin recording the sermon by placing your mobile device next to the speaker. If it's a guest speaker, please come early to introduce yourself and let them know that you will be recording the sermon during that time.

You will then retrieve your mobile device during the offering prayer, which will be right before the Announcements. Don't forget to save the file!

## Trim Sermon
[Trim .m4a file on your Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2010/09/16/trim-mp3-on-your-mac/) 
Using QuickTime Player trim the sermon. The sermon should start when the speaker begins preaching and end after the concluding prayer.

If you don't have a Mac, you can also use [AudioTrimmer](https://audiotrimmer.com/), which allows you to Trim files pretty accurately by typing in the specific seconds manually.
