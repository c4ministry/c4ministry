# Uploading a Sermon

## Record Sermon
After the reading of God's word will come the Prayer of Illumination. During that prayer, go to the podium and begin recording the sermon by placing your mobile device next to the speaker. If it's a guest speaker, please come early to introduce yourself and let them know that you will be recording the sermon during that time.

You will then retrieve your mobile device during the offering prayer, which will be right before the Announcements. Don't forget to save the file!

## Trim Sermon
[AudioTrimmer](https://audiotrimmer.com/) allows you to Trim files pretty accurately by typing in the specific seconds manually or selecting from the range of the audio file. The sermon should start when the speaker begins preaching and end after the concluding prayer.

If you prefer you can use QuickTime Player to trim the sermon.
